# Binary-search-tree

BST implementation (insert node, print data, delete node, delete tree)

This project is a binary search tree implementation.<br/>
* each node in this tree containe data(intiger number) and two pointer one to the left node of the tree and the second to right node of the tree.<br/>
* the progremme will give the user 4 option to choose:<br/>
  1) add New number: if the user chooses number 1 the programme will ask him to enter a number, and automaticly the programme will create a node and insert the number that the user entered into the node created.<br/>
  2) show numbers: if the chooses number 2 the programme will print all the number in the binary search tree inorder.<br/>
  3) delete a number: if the user chooses number 3 the programme will ask him to enter the number he want to delete and the node that containe this number will be deleted automaticly from the memory.<br/>
  0) exit: if the user chooses number 0 the programme will delete all the nodes in the memory and will stop running.<br/>
